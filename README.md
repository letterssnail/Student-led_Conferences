# Student-led Conferences

Student-led conferences present the opportunity for students to lead conferences informing their parents and guardians about their academic progress. Through the program students are able to take control of their learning experience which is a key component to creating an environment in which students can thrive to achieve their best at Surf Coast Secondary College.

Parents and guardians have expressed interest in a redesign of the student-led conference forms and have outlined various design choices that, while meeting the requirements of a booking form, have created an unintuitive and complicated experience.
