# Student-led Conferences

Student-led conferences present the opportunity for students to lead conferences informing their parents and guardians about their academic progress. Through the program students are able to take control of their learning experience which is a key component to creating an environment in which students can thrive to achieve their best at Surf Coast Secondary College.

Parents and guardians have expressed interest in a redesign of the student-led conference forms and have outlined various design choices that, while meeting the requirements of a booking form, have created an unintuitive and complicated experience.

### Audience
This redesign of the form's functional requirements is to provide a platform for students and their guardians to reserve a conference time at the student-led conferences. It will have a system that allows teachers to view the times that their student's families have reserved.

To provide a system for the reservation of student-led conference times, a database with user information will be required. The form will provide a platform in which a system administrator can view, manage and run this database.

### Scope
The primary goal of this project is to remodel the user experience of the original form, providing a more intuitive and straight-forward experience to users.

Additional goals of the project are to increase the depth of the form by providing additional features. The system will incorporate a database that includes additional information on the assocations of guardians, teachers and students which allows users to reserve a time without requiring the knowledge of the subjects the student is undertaking.
